# EconometrcisMLProject
In this project I analyzed population of various countries to draw conclusions about dependencies of the factors on Population 
and tried to presume what can have the strongest/weakest impact. Plus, tried to find out some pecularities.
It was a combination of Econometrics and Machine Learning.

1)In word file you can check for overall description of the project. 
In a nutshell, I took dataset and analyzed data via Pandas and Numpy, used Sklearn to make models, 
via PyPlot created graphs, statsmodels and linearmodels were used for econometric analysis, seaborn for matrix

2)html can be seen without Anaconda and if you have Anaconda you can use ipynb

3)Also, the very dataset is in csv
